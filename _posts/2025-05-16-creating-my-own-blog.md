Hello, 

My name is Lou, I'm from France and 30 in few months !

Recently, I changed from Windows 10 only, to Win10 x Linux Mint Cinnamon, to Mint only for a few days, then to a Mint x Fedora 42 workstation for few days, then Fedora convinced me and I made a full clean install to a Fedora only system.

I'm discovering Jekyll as much as I am new to Fedora, so it's a new open-source world that's unfolding for me. I'll document everything here, and slowly possibly customise and sort out the pages as I learn along the way :)

Anyhoo, I love all of this ! It's exciting to discover from scratch and be finally the master of even how my contents is displayed from the very beginning :p
