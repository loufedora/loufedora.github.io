Man, while doing a local Jekyll was quite easy, Github was quite circonvoluted for nothing since many of the tutorials didn't correspond to what I saw in my laptop and in the Github personal space. BUT I finally did it after HOURS.

After many different sources, I noticed that the fork worked and the git clone command too. So I did both while creating a new depository with the website name I wanted. From there, I had the same things in my laptop and online. I used Github Actions option to get the workflow history.

It wasn't peculiarly easy to understand that from there, you modify the files LOCALLY (in laptop) and then run terminal commands to get it updated on github. Fortunately, [one video I watched previously](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ-qvsxPHpY) actually explained it from the very beginning, so I ran those and it seems to work now !

Also, it seems that the tool is very sensitive if you touch "about" or erase lines in config.yml or in about.md. It destroyed my sync that worked well before, so don't do that ! Just fill the blanks or leave it be.
