Oh my lord. Seems that I installed a package that was maybe well adapted for Fedora 41, but not really for 42. I don't know what happened exactly, I followed the youtube + Git tutorial of the person who designed it, it seemed to work back in November 2024 since in the comments, it visibly worked for everyone. BUT OF COURSE, for me... It made the login unavailable. I could reach the login window but it didn't recognise my password, even if I chose the correct language display.

Idk what was going on but the result is.. Somehow timeshift on live USB wouldn't enable me to restore my system because.. I think some option wouldn't restore the EFI partition or something, it didn't allow me to proceed. So yeah, had to reinstall from scratch totally.

Since it already happened before (to this point I definitely know the base install config with Gnome tweaks and all lol), I knew what to do and fortunately, all is back. I didn't lose anything since the only things I had were virtual gnome machines (not well advanced lol), the git repository that I can reclone anyway (and that I saved in another disk) and easily redownloadable software or fonts.

Conclusion : I'll just wait Fedora team to release Hyprland official install for Fedora lol ! Wayland is just fine for now. Hyprland is cool but unfortunately, wasn't the good time yet. I guess something in the config changed when it all switched to 42.
