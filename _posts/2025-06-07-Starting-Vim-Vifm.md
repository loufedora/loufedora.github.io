So, I'm starting two things that function rather similarly at the same time, because they seem peculiarly useful :
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
<br/> 
- Vim, as it seems quite appropriate for my text usage. I already use markdown for this blog and it actually seems to support markdown well. I didn't install the plugin just yet, few were recommanded by The Linux Cast in [his advice about how to write better in Vim](https://youtu.be/GOCVCn5tlmo?si=lygblLTryKgLu4oe) so I'll definitely check that later.
The video tutorial which really helped me getting the basics right in a simple manner yet detailed are the ones of Learn Linux TV, the series is available [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT98CRl2KxKHy4A5N70jMRYAROzzC2a6x&si=ogjm39JQnZ9pt72O). His channel in general is quite user friendly and helps me a lot in my Linux journey.

- A TUI file manager, aka one that you can use in the terminal. I find this quite cool, and the one I've chosen, Vifm, is simple to get used to and enables me to remember Vim's key bindings, since actually it works the same. I peculiarly enjoy the fact that like in Vim, I can open two documents at the same time in vertical mode, like that if I have to copy a markdown or CSS from a previous article, I can do it in no time.

Well, it's not as simple because I have to get used to the bindings so I mix up a little, but it's fun. I like doing more things in the terminal that aren't only just copy pasting or troubleshooting. It's quite nice also not to have to quit the terminal to open the notepad or Libreoffice or such, it's so much smoother like that. I copy a previous doc to keep the structure, modify the contents, :wq it and I'm good to go to commit it through the magic 3 Git lines. I will uninstall VS Codium, it doesn't streamline it as well. Maybe another post will happen once I installed the plugins ? Let's see haha :p
