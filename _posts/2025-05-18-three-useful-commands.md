Below are three commands I wish I'd heard about at the straight beginning of my Linux journey : 

1. `man` to have a long description of a command, to understand what it does actually, what info it grabs and where, etc. The manual is very precise and in my native language so I don't even need brainpower to understand it. 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

2. `tldr` is the short version of `man`, a summary in few lines. It's nice for a quick understanding. Some parts are in my native language (french), some others weren't translated yet so they're in English per default.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

3. I mentioned it in one of the earlier posts, but `--assumeno` at the end of an `install` command can save a lot of trouble. It shows all the packages and dependencies that happen when you install something new, and eventually if it uninstalls one or few things. And it answers 'no' to the command so it gives you opportunity to think about it instead of installing the thing by just clicking yes/no. Can be a useful step when you're not sure of things.
